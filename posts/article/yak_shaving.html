<h2>I am still shaving the yak</h2>
<p>Let me give you the definition of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaving</a> first.</p>
<p>Then jump into the main topic. Lately I decided to pick up my covid era game design and implement it as a video game. The game is a deck building game and my first design was a board game (or table top game). But during my endless scroll of YouTube, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a> video and thought "huh, that seems easy"</p>
<p>So, I picked up the project again, right? Ha, you bet!</p>
<p>First, I started thinking about a note taking method, which I can sync my notes between an Android phone, an Apple tablet and a desktop computer. All use different accounts so login via Google should not be the only way to sync notes. It should support hand writing. and many more. I even wrote a post about it in my notebook (I mean, pen and paper, a real one). Finally I found a solution that works for me.</p>
<p>Then I described the deck and the cards in a note as far as I remember. Unfortunately I threw away my covid era prototype while moving so it took some time for me to remember and materialize the thoughts.</p>
<p>This has been followed by watching a couple Godot videos, a couple "how much we earned from our game" videos, many <a href="www.youtube.com/@GMTK">GMTK</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JuniperDev">JuniperDev</a> videos. Which led me to think about pixel-art style for my own game. Aaaand I started to draw <a href="../art/duckie.html">Duckie</a>. Then I drew some more and a couple more.</p>
<p>While drawing, commuting, walking I also started to think about a story for my "Cardboard Cars" which still is not written anywhere except my brain.</p>
<p>Finally I also decided that maybe I should start a devlog. So I can use my own <a href="https://github.com/CanburakTumer/tiniest_static_website">Tiniest Website Creator</a> on one more place, I can find excuses to record YouTube videos, I can share my drawings without shame. And I built this website.</p>
<p>As you can understand, I still did not write a single line of code.</p>
<p>Let me shave this tiny spot too, then I will start. I promise.</p>

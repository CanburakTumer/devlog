<h2>Should I tell a story?</h2>
<p>I am planning to build a card game, which I still don't know if it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck-building_game">deck-building game</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game">trading card game</a>. I have ideas regarding how a game will progress, but if I can find play testers I will iron out the details there.</p>
<p>Lately I was thinking a story component can add some color to the game. I can justify progress and unlock more content as I lay the bricks of the story. Then I remembered the quote that is attributed to Tolstoy:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All great literature is one of two stories; either a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town."  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I am thinking, that our story will begin with a child in elementary school age whose parents decide to move to a new town, for reasons. Where our protagonist needs to build their network of friends again, while climbing the ladders of being a popular child in the neighborhood. As they win game after game, they will be invited to new games, sleepovers to play card games till morning. Each chapter of the story will reveal new cards or some bonus moves.</p>
<p>That sounds like a good plan to keep players' interest in the game.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should I tell a story during a card game? You can let me know your thoughts on <a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zxbywmgqqwgaotv5xvp63cdn">BlueSky</a></p>
<p>Until next post, keep gaming!</p>

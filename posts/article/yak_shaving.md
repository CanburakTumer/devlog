## I am still shaving the yak

Let me give you the definition of [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) first.

Then jump into the main topic. Lately I decided to pick up my covid era game design and implement it as a video game. The game is a deck building game and my first design was a board game (or table top game). But during my endless scroll of YouTube, I stumbled upon a [Godot Engine]() video and thought "huh, that seems easy"

So, I picked up the project again, right? Ha, you bet!

First, I started thinking about a note taking method, which I can sync my notes between an Android phone, an Apple tablet and a desktop computer. All use different accounts so login via Google should not be the only way to sync notes. It should support hand writing. and many more. I even wrote a post about it in my notebook (I mean, pen and paper, a real one). Finally I found a solution that works for me.

Then I described the deck and the cards in a note as far as I remember. Unfortunately I threw away my covid era prototype while moving so it took some time for me to remember and materialize the thoughts.

This has been followed by watching a couple Godot videos, a couple "how much we earned from our game" videos, many [GMTK](www.youtube.com/@GMTK) and [JuniperDev](https://www.youtube.com/@JuniperDev) videos. Which led me to think about pixel-art style for my own game. Aaaand I started to draw [Duckie](../art/duckie.html). Then I drew some more and a couple more.

While drawing, commuting, walking I also started to think about a story for my "Cardboard Cars" which still is not written anywhere except my brain.

Finally I also decided that maybe I should start a devlog. So I can use my own [Tiniest Website Creator]() on one more place, I can find excuses to record YouTube videos, I can share my drawings without shame. And I built this website.

As you can understand, I still did not write a single line of code.

Let me shave this tiny spot too, then I will start. I promise.
